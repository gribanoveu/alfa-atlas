// leaked `renderHook` instance keeps its effects — and its global event
// listeners — alive for the rest of the file, so one dispatched `window`
// event reaches every instance the file ever created, not just the one under
// test. It also stops each file paying to keep its earlier renders running.

// Imported dynamically, after `register()`: a static import is hoisted above
// it, and `@testing-library/react` wants the DOM globals at module-load time.
