# AGENTS.md

Context for AI coding agents (Claude Code and others) working in this repository.

## Project

**Alfa Atlas** — a documentation editor that works directly with Git repositories.

- Identifier: `com.eugene.alfa-atlas`
- Stack: Tauri v2, React + TypeScript frontend, Rust backend
- Package manager: **bun** — always use `bun`/`bunx`, never `npm`/`pnpm`/`yarn`

Tech stack
Frontend: React 19 + TypeScript, Vite build, plain CSS files per component (no CSS-in-JS/Tailwind), lucide-react for icons. No global state library (Redux/Zustand/Context store) — state lives in custom hooks (src/hooks/*) composed directly into components (e.g. useLlmChat, useLlmSetup).

Backend: Tauri v2 (Rust), ureq (blocking HTTP client, not reqwest) for LLM provider calls, tauri::async_runtime::spawn_blocking to run them off the async runtime. Streaming deltas and other progress reach the frontend as tauri::Emitter events, emitted in commands/ only — services report through sinks (see Architecture).

## Setup & commands

```bash
bun install                 # install frontend deps
bun run tauri dev           # run the app with hot reload
bun run tauri build         # production bundle
bun run tsc --noEmit        # type-check frontend only
cd src-tauri && cargo check # fast Rust check while iterating
cd src-tauri && cargo test  # run Rust tests
cd src-tauri && cargo add <crate>   # add a Rust dependency
bun add <pkg>                       # add a JS dependency
```

Run `bun run tsc --noEmit` and `cargo check` before considering a change done. If tests exist for the touched area, run them too — don't assume green.

## Architecture

The app is layered; keep new code in the right layer instead of adding logic to the boundary.

```
src/                      # React frontend
├── components/           # render only — no fetching, no business rules
├── hooks/                 # frontend application layer: call invoke() wrappers, hold state
└── lib/                    # two things: one typed wrapper per Tauri command, plus shared pure helpers

src-tauri/src/
├── commands/              # boundary: thin #[tauri::command] fns — validate input, call a service, map errors to String
├── services/               # application layer: use-case orchestration
├── domain/                  # pure types + business rules + typed error enums (thiserror), no I/O, no framework types
└── infra/                    # git2 / filesystem / network — concrete implementations of domain traits
```

Dependency direction points inward: `commands → services → domain`, and `infra` implements traits that `domain`/`services` define — never the reverse. Don't reach for `git2` or `tauri::` types from inside `domain/` or `services/`.

**Reporting outward crosses a port, never an `AppHandle`.** A service that needs to tell the UI something takes a sink — `Arc<dyn Fn(Event) + Send + Sync>`, with the event type in `domain/` — and the command layer is the only place that turns those into Tauri events. Existing sinks: `embedding_sync::ProgressSink`, `domain::llm::ChatEventSink`, `domain::workspace_index::WorkspaceIndexEventSink`, `domain::embeddings::ModelDownloadSink`; their adapters live in `commands/chat_events.rs`, `commands/workspace_events.rs` and next to the relevant commands. When a service reports more than one kind of thing, use one enum rather than several callbacks. `tauri::async_runtime` used purely as a thread pool (`spawn_blocking`) is fine in `services/` — that's a runtime, not the UI.

Don't pre-build all four layers for something trivial. Introduce a trait boundary when there's a real second implementation (e.g. a test double) or a use-case spanning multiple infra calls — not speculatively.

See [`AI_HARNESS.md`](AI_HARNESS.md) for the AI-agent tool-access infrastructure (`domain/ai_access.rs`, `domain/ai_tools.rs`, `services/ai_tools/`). It is fully wired: `services::llm_chat` runs the tool-calling loop against it, and the assistant panel drives it from the UI.

## Errors

- Model failures as data as deep into the stack as possible: `thiserror` enums in `domain/`, not `String`.
- Flatten to `String` (or a small serializable DTO) only inside `commands/`, at the IPC boundary — that's the one place stringly-typed errors are acceptable.
- No `unwrap()`/`expect()` outside of tests and truly-unreachable invariants.

## IPC conventions

- Every `#[tauri::command]` gets a matching typed wrapper in `src/lib/` — components/hooks call the wrapper, never `invoke()` directly.
- New commands must be registered in `generate_handler![]` in `lib.rs` (`main.rs` only calls `run()`), and any new plugin/API surface needs a corresponding entry in `src-tauri/capabilities/*.json` — a command that "does nothing" at runtime usually means a missing capability entry, not a missing registration.
- Long-running git operations (clone, fetch) run as `async` commands or via `spawn_blocking`, not on the IPC event loop.

## Filesystem & git

- Prefer `git2` over shelling out to `git` for programmatic operations (diff, blame, branch listing); shell out only for actions you don't want to reimplement, isolated to one module.
- Validate/canonicalize any path coming from the frontend against the opened repo root before touching it.
- Use `std::path::Path`/`PathBuf` throughout — no manual path string concatenation (the app targets macOS/Windows/Linux).

## Style

- Prefer immutable data and explicit, exhaustive error handling (`match` over ignoring `Err`).
- Keep abstractions proportionate to actual need — don't add a layer, trait, or generic parameter for a hypothetical future case.
- Match existing patterns in the file/module you're editing before introducing a new one.

### UI

**Don't use a browser control where the app already draws its own.** The app renders its interactive widgets itself, so a native one arrives with the platform's look — a macOS `<select>` among hand-styled panels reads as something pasted in from another program, and it ignores the theme tokens everything else is built from.

The pattern for a dropdown is a `<button>` trigger plus a menu of `role="option"` buttons, dismissed by an outside `pointerdown` or `Escape`. Existing implementations to copy: `.method-select*` (`HttpRequestBuilder`), `.oas-select*` (`OpenApiExplorer`), `.assistant-mode-*` (`AssistantConversation`), `.jira-select*` (`JiraIssueTypePicker`). The same applies to anything else the platform would draw its own way — `<input type="checkbox">` is styled through `.settings-check`, dialogs are the app's own modal shell rather than `alert`/`confirm`.

Colours, spacing and fonts come from the tokens in `src/styles/tokens.css` (`--bg-*`, `--text-*`, `--border`, `--accent`, `--font-ui*`). A literal hex or pixel font size in a component is a bug: it will not follow the user's theme or font-size preference.

A component used from more than one place carries its own styles rather than borrowing a neighbour's — CSS is bundled globally, so borrowing appears to work right up until the neighbour is deleted.

## Commit / PR expectations

- Keep commits scoped to one layer or one concern where practical.
- Run the relevant checks above before marking work done; mention in the summary which checks were run.
